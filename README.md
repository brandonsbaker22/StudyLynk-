## Project Journey & Evolution

This project started as a standard assignment for my Web Design class, but as I began building it felt that it came up short and not as the verison I was aim for so as I started to build pages and look at the outline, I saw an opportunity to create something more engaging and professional than just a basic, static site. My initial wireframes were simple, but as I worked with the content and the design, I made several key changes to better serve the user and create a more polished final product.

### The Evolution of the Design

The look and feel of the site went through a few iterations. I initially experimented with a much brighter, more corporate color scheme, and then a very dark, stylized theme. Ultimately, I settled on the current palette of dark navy, gold, and cream because it felt more professional and academic, while still being warm and inviting.

As I built out the pages, I also found that some of my initial structural ideas could be improved. For example, I originally planned for a very simple "About" page. However, I realized that focusing on the tutors themselves would be more compelling for potential students, so that page evolved into the "Meet the Tutors" (`tutors.html`) page, which gives each tutor their own story. Similarly, I decided to move the links for FAQ, Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy to the footer. This keeps the main navigation at the top of the page clean and focused on the most important user journeys, like finding services or contacting the team.

A big part of the process was also a full readability audit. After building the initial pages, I went back through and realized that some of my text and background color combinations were difficult to read. I took the time to fix these issues across the entire site to make sure everything was accessible and clear for the user.

### Page Overviews

Here is a look at how each page functions within the site:

*   **Home (`index.html`):** This is the front door to the site. It introduces the mission of StudyLynk, shows the faces of the team, and gives a high-level overview of the services offered. I wanted to establish trust and personality right away.

*   **Services (`services.html`):** This page gets into the details. It breaks down the different tutoring options, workshops, and courses. I included a clear pricing table to be transparent with users. This page also originally had an FAQ section where the questions were hard to see, which I fixed by adjusting the text color to be visible at all times.

*   **Meet the Tutors (`tutors.html`):** Instead of a generic "About" page, I gave each tutor their own section with a photo and a backstory. I felt it was important for students to connect with the people they would be learning from.

*   **FAQ (`faq.html`):** As the site grew, I realized a dedicated FAQ page would be helpful. I added this page to provide a central place for users to find answers to common questions about tutoring, billing, and services. It uses a simple accordion script to keep the layout clean.

*   **Contact (`contact.html`):** A straightforward contact page with a form and direct contact information. I initially had some readability issues here with light text on a light background, which I corrected by changing the panel backgrounds to navy to ensure the white text was clear.

*   **Terms & Privacy (`terms.html`, `privacy.html`):** These are the standard legal pages. Like the contact page, I had to adjust the styling here from a dark-on-dark theme to a more readable light background with dark text to ensure they were accessible.
